# rclgo

The goal of this repository is to create a wrapper using cgo for the C library developed for ROS2 dashing using the ROS Client Libraries API (RCL).

**ADVICE**: This project is **under development**. It is not totally functional yet.

## Pre-requisites

cgo is used for the library wrapping. It is assumed that you have ros dashing installed in `/opt/ros/dashing`.

You will also need to source the install:
```bash
. /opt/ros/dashing/setup.sh
```
